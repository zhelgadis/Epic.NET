<p>Epic is an open source framework designed to keep your domain model implementation fully focused 
on the enterprise business targeted by the application, with an infrastructure ignorant fashion.</p>
<p>It achieves a new kind of dependency inversion, where the domain model settles at the core: 
everything will depend on it (even the infrastructure) while the domain model itself will be clean,
mantainable and ready for reuse.</p>
<p>Such design comes from the consideration that an enterprise application evolves over different,
indipendent axes:
<ul>
<li>the tecnology changes with the skills of the developers involved (and too often the marketing claims of few vendors)</li>
<li>the customers' requirements change as their business evolves</li>
<li>the user interface evolves through the users feedback (but always depends on the handled business)</li>
<li>the storage tecniques change with the load requirements and the usage patterns</li>
<li>the deploy depends on marketing strategies</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Complex requirements lead to complex domain models. To keep such 
models clean and maintainable we have to decouple them from unrelated aspects 
such as presentation, logging, persistence and so on.</p>
<p>Epic makes the scene.</p>
