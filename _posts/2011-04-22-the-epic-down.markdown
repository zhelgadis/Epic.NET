title: The Epic down
---

The first step on the [roadmap][1] has been done.

You can download the first public release of Epic.NET, containing the [classical
cargo shipping domain model][2] adapted to the Epic's idioms, patterns and best practices.

This release end the project start-up phase, that proved my own constancy in many
boring (if essential) tasks such as choosing the right tools, developing this site, 
writing a realistic sample domain fully covered by unit tests and so on.

The result is not perfect, but... it's good enough!

Now I'll start writing the architecture documentation and the main interfaces,
while looking for some other (high skilled) contributors.
